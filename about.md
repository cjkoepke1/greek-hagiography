This website is meant to serve as an online repository for hagiography of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, thereby making the texts accessible to the public. These lightly edited digital editions are based on those edited by the Bollandists in the *Acta Sanctorum*, a quasi-encyclopedic, multi-volume edition of Greek and Latin saints' lives first begun in the 17th century. The texts are organized according to feast day although BHG (Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca) numbers are also provided.

More texts will be added over time as they are prepared. 

### A note on spelling and punctuation

The orthography and punctuation of the *Acta Sanctorum* editions has mostly been preserved here. Names of persons and places are capitalized as well as the intial letters of sections and quotations. Otherwise, minuscule characters are used. 

Marks of punctuation include the period and the comma, the raised dot · (equivalent to the English colon and semi-colon), and the question mark ; (equivalent to '?'). Guillemets are employed to offset dialogue. 

Chapter and section breaks follow those established by the editors of the *Acta Sanctorum*.
